* JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities that allows you to build interactivity into otherwise static HTML pages.

* A JavaScript consists of JavaScript statements that are placed within the `<script>... </script>` HTML tags in a web page.

* You can place the `<script>` tag containing your JavaScript anywhere within you web page but it is preferred way to keep it within the `<head>` tags.

* The `<script>` tag alert the browser program to begin interpreting all the text between these tags as a script. So simple syntax of your JavaScript will be as follows
#####Example
```
<script ...>
  JavaScript code
</script>
```
